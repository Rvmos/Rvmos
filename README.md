- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rvmos
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about HTML, CSS, Javascript, & languages to get certified in Web-Design with credibility, of course! :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/XML, CSS slowly, & trying to get the hang of JavaScript Syntax usage.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a website for marketing promotion status, helping local companies in small-town businesses advertise themselves!
- 📫 How to reach me
